    This initiative aims to enhance automation, bolster cybersecurity, and streamline digital services across various sectors.

    What is PKI?
    ----------------
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that enables secure electronic transactions by using a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key.
    It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of digital communications, essential for secure online interactions.

    Iraq's PKI Initiative
    ------------------------
    The Iraqi Ministry of Communications, in collaboration with international partners, has developed the PKI system.
    Notably, the technology and implementation are delivered by Ascertia, a UK-based company specializing in digital trust solutions.

    This move is part of a broader strategy to modernize Iraq's digital infrastructure and improve services for both citizens and institutions.

    Benefits of the New PKI Service
    -----------------------------------
    1. Enhanced Security:
       - Protects sensitive data and communications from cyber threats.
    2. Streamlined Digital Services:
       - Automates processes and expedites service delivery.
    3. E-Government Enablement:
       - Allows citizens to access services online such as permits, taxes, and official documents.
    4. E-Commerce Growth:
       - Builds confidence in online transactions.
    5. Global Compliance:
       - Aligns Iraq with international digital security standards.

    Future Outlook
    ------------------
    The implementation of the PKI system includes creating a strong legal framework, public awareness campaigns, and training initiatives.
    In the long term, it will support smart cities, secure e-banking, and trusted digital identities.

    Iraqâ€™s launch of a national PKI service is a pivotal step toward secure, efficient, and accessible e-services across all sectors.
